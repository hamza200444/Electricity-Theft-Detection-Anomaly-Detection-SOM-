Electricity Theft Detection Using SOM

This project detects electricity theft using SOM (Self-Organizing Map).
The model learns from normal customer data to find unusual usage.
It uses features like usage, appliances, residents, and bill delays.
Extra features like Usage_per_Appliance help detect anomalies.
Each customer gets a risk score for theft.
Red dots = high risk, Green dots = normal.
The SOM U-Matrix shows clusters and unusual patterns.
The confusion matrix shows how well the model works.
This helps find potential theft quickly.
All code, data, and models are in this repository.
